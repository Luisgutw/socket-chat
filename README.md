# SOCKET-CHAT APPLICATION
This is a basic, real time chat application based on Sockets.<br> I set up an echo server you can connect to.<br>Python was used for the logical part and Tkinter for the GUI.

IP and port can be changed within the code.

How it works:<br>
First start the echo-server.py file to setup your Server. Next start the echo-client.py file to connect to the server and enter qour username to start chatting.
You can connect to the server with multiple clients.
